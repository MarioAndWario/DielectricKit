## Makefile (D. Strubbe Jan 2012)
## This is not the one that comes with spglib (generated by automake and configure).
## It has been simplified and made compatible with the arch.mk of BerkeleyGW.
## The actual content is really in common-rules.mk.

PREFIX=../..
include $(PREFIX)/Common/common-rules.mk

# this target is flavorless
default: spglib
all: spglib
