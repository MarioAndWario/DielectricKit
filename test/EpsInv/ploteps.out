 low_comm: We will store entire epsmat.h5 on each proc.
 Dealing with file:chimat.h5

 List of output files:
 Output module square of epsinv.
 We will use self-adaptive FFT grid (using peps cutoff) to plot low-resolution image.

 Unfolding epsinv matrix using symmetry.

 Real-space grid will be downsampled by a factor of:   1    1    1
 Real-space FFTgrid will be multiplied by a factor of:   1
 G-cutoff for epsinv used in FFT :      5.000 Ry

 chi(G=Gp=0)(q-->0) = 0
 We will consider     1 r2 points (in fractional coordinates): 
 #    1       0.000000       0.000000       0.000000

 - Supercell size:   2    2    2
 - Qgrid :   2    2    2  with    8 qpoints in full BZ
 - G-cutoff of epsinv read from chimat.h5 :      5.000 Ry
 - Target frequency : (     0.00000,     0.00000).
 - ifreq_target in chimat.h5 =     1
 Distribute fq points:
 - Maximal number of full BZ qpoint on a proc: 8
 - Number of idle procs : 0
