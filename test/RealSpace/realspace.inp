#> Verbosity level, options are: 
#> 1 = default 
#> 2 = medium - info about k-points, symmetries, and eqp corrections. 
#> 3 = high   - full dump of the reduced and unfolded k-points. 
#> 4 = log    - log of various function calls. Use to debug code. 
#> 5 = debug  - extra debug statements. Use to debug code. 
#> 6 = max    - only use if instructed to, severe performance downgrade. 
#> Note that verbosity levels are cumulative. Most users will want to stick 
#> with level 1 and, at most, level 3. Only use level 4+ if debugging the code.

#> Instead of calculating epsinv every real-space grid point, we can
#> downsample the grid by the following factor (each number controls the 
#> downsampling for the corresponding particular axis [x,y,z]). Note that the
#> real-space grid is rounded up, so that there will be at least one point no
#> matter now much you downsample it!
